# Personal Website with React

https://celikk.me

After several years of service, it was time to deprecate my [old website](https://github.com/celikkoseoglu/personalwebsite) and build a new one. It was showing it's age and was difficult to maintain compared to a modern website built using modern tools.

So, I've stated this project to port everything over from my previous website into a React project. I didn't know any react at the beginning, and I still don't know a lot but this project is a great opportunity for me to learn.

For now, this will be the main source of my Personal Website for some time (probably until something else replaces React in the future). I will be making small changes from time to time and with every change, this repo will be updated.

#### But most importantly,

I have been doing streams while I work on this project. If you want to see my learning process, join the discussion. Give me recommendations on what/how to do.
