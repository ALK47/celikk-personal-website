I am making a new personal website to replace https://celikk.me

Things I'm working on: 

* Separate CV page from the homepage
* Transfer image assets from original website into this one
* Where should we fit the new hero image? (Design something new with Sketch maybe?)
* Fonts! Make sure the fonts are right
* Recreate all of the previous website's original content using React
* Particle effects and fireworks?
* After effects and react together -> how?
* Add tests???? (never done react tests before :shrug:)
* Keep master as the MVP branch after it looks ready to ship. (currently committing directly into master)
