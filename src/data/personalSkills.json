    "text": "At the age of 13, I started coding with Microsoft SmallBasic. Then, I walked out of a bookstore with a C# book in my hand. Then, started making Windows Desktop apps. Mobile technologies were rapidly developing at that time so I made some progress with Mobile Technologies. With the little C# knowledge I had, I made QNote and PhotoSec for Windows Phone. Then continued on with other platforms and other technologies. Now I amcomfortable to work with several programming languages and frameworks. Make sure to go through my CV for more details!"
