### The first app I've ever published

Technologies Used: `Microsoft Visual Studio`, `C# .NET`, `WPF`

Was Available For: `Windows Desktop`, `Windows Phone`

This blog is special to me. Because QNote is the first ever application that I published.

The story of QNote begins in 2011. I was fifteen years old and still in high school. I was reading some random programming books since I was twelve, 
and experimenting with stuff on the side but I had no solid understanding of the big picture.

One day, I went to the nearest book store and asked for a programming book for iOS because the iPhone was getting really popular.
The fifteen year old version of me wanted to get an iPhone, jailbreak it, install cool homebrew stuff etc. At the same time, I wanted to start
learning how people actually made apps for this device. However, the bookstore had no books on Objective-C. I walked out the
bookshop with a book called Step By Step C# 2011 by John Sharp. (That was how I never learnt Objective-C. Now, the year is 2019 and I'm up for the
challenge if need be)

So while reading this C# book, I started making some experimental Windows Desktop applications using C# .NET. At first, everything looked 
weird compared to my previous adventures because you had this .XAML file to define a layout and C# code to implement UI behaviour.
This was the first time I was introduced to GUI programming.

Anyway, a short while later, I had something that looked like this:

It was cool (to me anyway). I uploaded it to sites.google.com and asked my friends to check it out.
 About 2 weeks later, I saw some people in my class using it. They were writing phone numbers, GTA cheat codes, homework tasks
 and all sorts of other things inside. It was more convenient than NotePad or Microsoft Word for them. It opened very quickly, and
 closed with a press of the ESC key. 
 
Some time later, Microsoft announced Windows Phone 8. Making apps for Windows Phone was very similar to Windows Desktop. This was how they were
planning to get many developers on-board. I was one of them, so I got myself a nice Lumia 920 and started porting QNote onto it. Many hours later,
it was ready to publish to Windows Phone store.

It looked like this:

And had the following description in the store:

> Makes note taking fast, simple and easy on Windows Phone devices.
 Unlike other note taking apps, QNote does not require the user to
  wait for a few seconds to get ready for note taking. It starts up
   in milliseconds, the user takes some notes and just lock the
    phone to close the application. Perfect for taking quick notes
     on the go!

In a similar fashion to the Windows Desktop version, it was extremely fast to start. That's probably because it was literally a TextBox
inside a view. But that's what some people wanted. A dead simple note taking application. Install size around 11KB.

In its two years on the Windows Phone Store, QNote got around 1200 downloads. It was always free. Always will be free. And as of the publication
date of this blog post, the Windows Desktop version is open source. You can all see how bad my coding skills were when I first started. It's all about
progress. We all start from somewhere.

// TODO Locate QNote for Windows Phone's source code and make it open source. I can't believe I lost the source code for it...
