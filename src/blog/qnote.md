# QNote

#### The most lightweight note taking app

Technologies Used: `Microsoft Visual Studio`, `C# .NET`, `WPF`

Was Available For: `Windows`, `Windows Phone`

This blog is special to me. Because QNote is the first ever application that I published to the world.

The story of QNote begins in 2012. I was 15-16 years old and still in high school. I was reading some random programming books since I was 12, 
and experimenting with stuff on the side but I had no solid understanding of how everything works before QNote.

One day, I went to the nearest book store and asked for a programming book for iOS because iPhone was getting really popular.
The teenager version of me wanted to get an iPhone, jailbreak it, install cool homebrew stuff etc. At the same time, I wanted to start
learning how people actually made apps for this device. Well, I wasn't able to find a book on Objective-C. I walked out the
bookshop with a book called Step By Step C# 2011 by John Sharp. That was how I never learnt Objective-C.

So while reading this book, I started making some experimental Windows Desktop applications using C# .NET. At first, everything looked 
weird compared to my previous adventures because you had this .XML file to define a layout and C# code to implement UI behaviour.
This was the first time I was introduced to GUI programming.

Anyway, a short while later, I had something that looked like this:

It was cool (to me anyway). I uploaded it to sites.google.com and asked my friends to check it out.
 About 2 weeks later, I saw some people in my class using it. They were writing phone numbers, GTA cheat codes, homeworks
 and all sorts of other things inside. It was more convenient than NotePad or Microsoft Word for them. It opened very quickly, and
 closed with a press of the ESC key. 


Makes note taking fast, simple and easy on Windows Phone devices.
 Unlike other note taking apps, QNote does not require the user to
  wait for a few seconds to get ready for note taking. It starts up
   in milliseconds, the user takes some notes and just locks the
    phone to close the application. Perfect for taking quick notes
     on the go!
