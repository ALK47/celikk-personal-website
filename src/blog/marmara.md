# TODAY'S MEAL IN MARMARA

#### What's in lunch today? Ah, here is my notification!

Technologies Used: `Xcode`, `Android Studio`, `Probably more stuff that I don't know yet`

~~Will be Available For: `Windows Phone?`, `iOS`, `Android`~~

(I've never got to complete this project. However, some student
 made a java library that retrieves the food in the cafeteria)

Most students wonder what is today's food in the cafeteria.
 Everyone goes to the school's website to learn about today's
  menu. What if we could send the menu to people's phones at 11:30
   every day? Also people could vote for the food. Therefore this
    application could also benefit the cafeteria management. Or not?
