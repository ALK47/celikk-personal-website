I was a student of Bilkent University once. In this blog post, I'm not
going to talk about my experience. I'm going to talk about the cafeteria
food in the uni. The cafeteria was called Marmara. Here is some info about [Marmara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmara_Region).

Marmara was pretty good. You went in, waited the queue for a short
time, then you grabbed a tray. There were a few options
for starters, mains, sides and desert. The problem is, you never knew what the
options were if you didn't check the Marmara's website. I mean, it wasn't
difficult to open the website, but one day during a dead boring class I thought
it might be cool if we could send the food menu as a notification to people's
phones.

I was in my junior year in uni and wanted to get back to mobile development.
This was it, I was going to extract the info from the website, and then send
it as a notification to the people who installed my app!

I made something and started prototyping, but uni was too strong. I never got
to complete this project. Then I got very busy in my senior year. I got obsessed
with having the best senior project the uni has ever seen. Our group did
something really cool.

Even though I've never got to complete this project, some student
made a java library that retrieves the food in the cafeteria. Here is a link
to his GitHub repo. If you're reading this, keep up the good work!

Most students wonder what is today's food in the cafeteria.
 Everyone goes to the school's website to learn about today's
  menu. What if we could send the menu to people's phones at 11:30
   every day? Also people could vote for the food. Therefore this
    application could also benefit the cafeteria management. Or not?
