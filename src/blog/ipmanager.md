# IPMANAGER

#### Switch Between DHCP and Static IP Easily

Technologies Used: `Microsoft Visual Studio`, `C# .NET`, `WPF`

Was Available For: `Windows`

My parents' workplace uses static IP and each time my dad brought his laptop over, he was setting the IP
settings manually. This is how I got the idea of making IPManager. What if there was this app that
manages your IP addresses based on the network you're connected to?

If a workplace uses static IP and the employees carry their
 ]computers between their homes and offices everyday, IPManager
  changes DHCP settings automatically, which saves everyone
   approximately one minute per day.
