# Personal Website with React

#### They said you should make a website.

Technologies Used: `React`, `Bootstrap`, `markdown-to-jsx`

Every wizard developer requires a personal website to tell about
 their skills. I've started to work on this in September 2015 and
  it is still occupying my time for development. I've learnt a
   lot of HTML, CSS & JavaScript during the development of this website.
