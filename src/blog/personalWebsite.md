# Personal Website with React

#### I want to keep up to date about what's going on in the front-end world.

Technologies Used: `React`, `Bootstrap`, `markdown-to-jsx`

Available for: `All devices with an internet browser`

The year was 2010, I was browsing Twitter and I started seeing more and more developers
making personal websites for themselves. Most of them were boring compared to
today's standards but almost every good developer that I knew had one. I was just
a kid with little to no programming knowledge. I had some SmallBasic and HTML
knowledge but to call it `tribal` would be an overstatement.

It wasn't until I went to uni that I learnt about making a website. Don't get me wrong,
it wasn't uni that taught me how to make a website. It was a friend of mine that
goes by the name Oguz Bilgener. He was one year older than me. We met during the
first day of uni. I can easily say he was one of the very few self-motivated people
out there that taught himself how all this stuff works. I've asked him how to get
started with these things, and he showed me a few pointers like nginx and
digitalocean. About a week later, I had a very basic HTML and CSS only website
running. It stayed like that for a long while.

Around a year later, my Twitter feed was filled with something called Bootstrap.
People were going crazy over it, they were all talking about how important `responsive`
design was. Bootstrap was a great solution to the Desktop to Mobile transition problem
back then.

Around that time, I started reading [HTML, CSS and JS by Jon Duckett.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/257-9138018-6001252?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1118907442&pd_rd_r=580a26ca-9170-4351-ad7c-3627862b1ed2&pd_rd_w=imqRD&pd_rd_wg=m42UH&pf_rd_p=e44592b5-e56d-44c2-a4f9-dbdc09b29395&pf_rd_r=28M7M0P31X4T4WP3TGXM&psc=1&refRID=28M7M0P31X4T4WP3TGXM)
I could easily say it was the prettiest book I've read so far, and trust me, I've read
quite a lot of programming books for my age compared to some of my contemporaries. This
book gave me enough courage to take a deep dive into Bootstrap. I downloaded some
templates off from a website that I don't remember right now, and modified it
enough that it would look like it's actually mine. Then I uploaded it, and it became
the foundation for the design that I have, even today.

Every great developer requires a personal website to tell about
their skills. I've started to work on this in September 2015 and
it is still occupying my time for development. I've learnt a
lot of HTML, CSS & JavaScript during the development of this website.

Around 3 years after Bootstrap update, I've decided to take on a new challenge. I've
been hearing about this React thing from some of my colleagues from my previous
workplace. They were all talking about how great React was. They were all saying it
makes it much easier to make websites and prototype with ideas. I was obviously
asking them about the performance, but turns out, it's not that bad.

Anyway. I initially got the idea from a friend of mine who goes by the name Sam.
His website is sld.codes. He was the one who convinced to take a side project at
work that involved some React. Even though I didn't contribute much function-wise,
I was the one who approved some of the pull requests, and occasionally did code
cleanups on the whole project. That's when I started seeing how useful it could be.
It definitely wasn't the highest performing framework that I've seen so far, but
it was good enough to solve the problem.

So sometime after I finished working on my new CV, I started working on this website.
Throughout my entire life, I got the same question many times from many different
people: How do you get started with programming and learning something new? The
answer is simple, you start reading about it and hack stuff together. That's when I
decided to stream myself making this website. I was going to film myself making
the website, and talk over it while working on it. Then people who are wondering
about this question could go back and watch how I taught myself basic React
so I could make this website.

Moral of the story is:

We all start from 0, just keep pushing each day.
